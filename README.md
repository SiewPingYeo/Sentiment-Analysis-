# Sentiment-Analysis-for Labeled Data

This project aims to build a sentiment analyzer based on sentiments of reviews by hotel guests on TripAdvisor. The hotel that we will be looking at will be Row NYC Hotel in New York City. There are a total of 13465 reviews scraped from the website using Selenium (the code can be found on GitHub Repo titled - Scraping TripAdvisor Reviews using Selenium). This repo will focus on labeled data as a base for model training. 

For this section, several approaches will be used to explore sentiment analysis:
1. Classical Machine Learning Models 
2. Deep learning 
    - BERT and tensowflow 

This repo aims to look at the different ways of performing sentiment analysis and analyse how each method differ with its pros and cons.
The reviews will be classified into Positive, Negative and Neutral sentiments. As such. this would be a supervised multi-class classification model.
